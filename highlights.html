<h2>Scalability in a wakefield acceleration simulation<a class="headerlink" href="#scalability-in-a-wakefield-acceleration-simulation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wakefield-acceleration of electrons in an underdense plasma creates a
hotspot of electrons, which makes the simulation strongly imbalanced.
This spot represent a large part of the total calculations, so that
more computing power should be allocated on it.</p>
<p>Please refer to the doc <a class="reference internal" href="parallelization.html"><span class="doc">Parallelization basics</span></a> to learn the basics of the
parallelization techniques employed in this section.</p>
<p class="rubric">1. OpenMP</p>
<p>In a local area around this hotspot, OpenMP is able to manage the computing
resources to make the overall simulation faster. The following figure shows
the evolution of the time to calculate 100 iterations, as a function of time.
Each line corresponds to a different partition of the box in terms of
MPI processes and OpenMP threads: <span class="math">\(N\times M\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(N\)</span> is
the total number of MPI processes, and <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is the number of threads
in each MPI process.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/openMP_balancing.png"><img alt="_images/openMP_balancing.png" src="_images/openMP_balancing.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p>Using more OpenMP threads per MPI process (while keeping the total number
of threads constant) clearly reduces the simulation time, because the
computing power is balanced within each MPI region.</p>
<p class="rubric">2. Dynamic load balancing between MPI processes</p>
<p>At the global simulation scale, OpenMP cannot be used to smoothen the balance.
Instead, a dynamic load balancing (DLB) algorithm periodically exchanges pieces of
the simulation box (<em>patches</em>) between MPI processes, so that each MPI
process owns a fair amount of the simulation load. The following figure
shows how this balancing reduces the time of the simulation.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/DLB_balancing.png"><img alt="_images/DLB_balancing.png" src="_images/DLB_balancing.png" style="width: 500px;" /></a>
<p>The red curve is the best situation obtained in the previous section, while
the black curve corresponds to the DLB algorithm enabled.</p>
<p>The portion of the box belonging to each MPI process varies when the load balancing
occurs. The following figure shows how each of these portions evolve with time.</p>
<img alt="_images/Patch_loadcomparision.jpg" src="_images/Patch_loadcomparision.jpg" />
<p>The four panels correspond to four timesteps during the simulation.
The colorscale represents the log-scaled load of each patch.
The black lines show the borders of each MPI process&#8217; portion of the box.
The MPI processes that are close to the hotspot tend to handle a smaller portion
of the box.</p>

<h2>High-harmonic generation<a class="headerlink" href="#high-harmonic-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The interaction between an ultra-intense (<span class="math">\(I&gt;10^{18}~{\rm W/cm^2}\)</span>) femtosecond laser pulse
with a solid target generates a dense &#8220;plasma mirror&#8221; at its surface that reflects the laser
in a strongly non-linear manner. The temporal distortion of the reflected wave creates
a train of ultra-short attosecond pulses, associated, in the frequency domain,
to a comb of high-order harmonics.</p>
<p>We present a 2-dimensional <strong class="program">Smilei</strong> simulation of laser-solid interaction
with wavelength <span class="math">\(\lambda_0 = 0.8\)</span> µm, peak intensity
<span class="math">\(2\times10^{19}~{\rm W/cm^2}\)</span>, at 45° incidence with p-polarization on an overdense plasma slab
of constant electron density <span class="math">\(n_0=200\,n_c\)</span> (<span class="math">\(n_c\)</span> being the critical density),
<span class="math">\(5\lambda_0\)</span>-thick, with an exponential pre-plasma of gradient length <span class="math">\(0.1\,\lambda_0\)</span>
down to a cut-off density <span class="math">\(0.05\,n_c\)</span>. The full box size is
<span class="math">\(80\,\lambda_0 \times 60\lambda_0\)</span> and the simulation time <span class="math">\(150\,\lambda_0/c\)</span>
with a total of <span class="math">\(\sim 1.4\)</span> billion quasi-particles in the box.</p>
<p>The following figure (top panel) shows half of the simulation box in the
y-direction, and the laser field is reported at three different times.
The reflected laser pulse (at time <span class="math">\(t_2\)</span>) shows a different spectral content than
the incident pulse (at time <span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>). The plasma electron density is shown in black.
A close-up view of the interaction region is given in the bottom panel, illustrating
the electron bunches being pulled out from the plasma surface.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/hhg1.jpg"><img alt="_images/hhg1.jpg" src="_images/hhg1.jpg" style="width: 13cm;" /></a>
<p>Fourier analysis of the reflected laser field, in space and time, provides the
angular distribution of the frequency spectrum of the reflected light, shown in the
following figure (top panel). High harmonics appear up to order 16.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/hhg2.jpg"><img alt="_images/hhg2.jpg" src="_images/hhg2.jpg" style="width: 13cm;" /></a>
<p>The bottom panel shows trajectories of accelerated electrons ejected from the target.
The angular histogram shows that the momenta of the escaping energetic electrons
(1 to 10 MeV) are mostly directed along two directions which are close to the reflected
laser direction.</p>
<p>This simulation was run on the CINES/Occigen (Bullx) machine using 256 MPI x 14 OpenMP
threads for about 10700 CPU-hours. The characteristic computing time per particle
(average PIC iteration divided by the number of particles) is of the order of
0.7 µs, including 25% for diagnostics.</p>

<h2>Brillouin amplification<a class="headerlink" href="#brillouin-amplification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Coupling, in a plasma, a long energetic &#8220;pump&#8221; pulse of moderate intensity to
a short counter-propagating &#8220;seed&#8221; pulse of initially low intensity can transfer energy
from the pump to the seed thanks to the excitation of a plasma wave <a class="reference internal" href="material.html#forslund1975" id="id1">[Forslund1975]</a>.
Here, we look specifically at the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) amplification,
where the excited waves are ion-acoustic waves.</p>
<p>A pump with intensity <span class="math">\(10^{15}\)</span> W/cm² (wavelength 1 µm)
correspond to the &#8220;strong-coupling&#8221; regime, particularly robust with respect to
plasma inhomogeneities and seed frequency <a class="reference internal" href="material.html#chiaramello2016" id="id2">[Chiaramello2016]</a>.</p>
<p>A 2-dimensional simulation, in conditions close to actual experiments, ran
on a box size of 1024 µm x 512 µm for  10 ps
with 25 billion quasi-particles. The following figure shows the evolution
of the pump and seed intensities in the head-on collision at three different times.
The blue-yellow maps correspond to the plasma density while the white-red maps
correspond to the lasers intensity.</p>
<img alt="_images/pump_seed.jpg" src="_images/pump_seed.jpg" />
<p>The final seed intensity is nearly 5 times its initial intensity
while the spot size and phase front are well conserved,
suggesting that such a beam could be further focused using plasma mirrors.</p>
<p>This simulation used the IDRIS/Turing (BlueGene/Q) super-computer using 1.8 million
CPU-hours on 32768 MPI processes, and 4 OpenMP threads per core.
The average time to push a particle was 1.9 µs, including 5%
for diagnostics. On the CINES/Occigen (Bullx) machine, we obtained an average time
of 0.43 µs to push one particle (without diagnostics).</p>

<div class="section" id="magnetic-reconnection-at-the-earth-magnetopause">
<h2>Magnetic reconnection at the Earth magnetopause<a class="headerlink" href="#magnetic-reconnection-at-the-earth-magnetopause" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Magnetic reconnection at the Earth magnetopause regulates the transport of matter,
momentum and energy from the solar wind to the internal magnetosphere.
The solar wind plasma temperature is typically one tenth that of the magnetospheric plasma,
but its density is about ten times larger, and its magnetic field 2-3 times smaller.
This asymmetry makes the reconnection dynamics vastly more complex than in symmetric
environments, and has only been studied for a decade via numerical simulations and
spacecraft observations <a class="reference internal" href="material.html#hesse2013" id="id3">[Hesse2013]</a>.</p>
<p>Studying the impact of a plasmaspheric plume on magnetopause reconnection
via kinetic numerical simulation is difficult. The simulation first needs
to reach a quasi-steady state reconnection with a typical magnetopause asymmetry,
see the arrival of the plume and then last longer for a quasi-steady state plume
reconnection regime to settle. Due to the large particle density of plumes,
the transition and last phases have substantially longer time scales than the early phase,
which makes the simulation heavy. The domain must be long enough in the downstream direction
for the plasma, expelled during the early and transition phases, to be evacuated from
the reconnection region. Otherwise, upstream plasma would not inflow,
thereby stopping reconnection.</p>
<p>Three ion populations are present.
The solar wind and magnetospheric populations have densities equal to <span class="math">\(n_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(n_0/10\)</span>,
respectively, on their side of the current sheet, and fall to zero on the other side.
The plume population increases from 0 to <span class="math">\(2\,n_0\)</span> at <span class="math">\(20\,c/\omega_{pi}\)</span> from the initial
current sheet on the magnetospheric side. The magnetic field amplitude goes from <span class="math">\(2\,B_0\)</span>
in the magnetosphere to <span class="math">\(B_0=m_e\omega_{pe}/e\)</span> in the solar wind and is totally in the
simulation plane. The temperature is initially isotropic and its profile is calculated
to balance the total pressure.</p>
<p>The domain size is 1280 <span class="math">\(c/\omega_{pi} \times\)</span> 256 <span class="math">\(c/\omega_{pi}\)</span>.
The total simulation time is <span class="math">\(800\times\)</span> the ion gyration time.
We used a reduced ion to electron mass ratio <span class="math">\(m_i/m_e = 25\)</span>, and a ratio
50 of the speed of light by the Alfvén velocity.
There are initially 8.6 billion quasi-protons for the three populations, and 13 billion electrons.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/reconnection.jpg"><img alt="_images/reconnection.jpg" src="_images/reconnection.jpg" style="width: 15cm;" /></a>
<p>This figure presents some of the simulation results:
the electron density at three different times.
In the top panel, reconnection is in steady state between the solar wind plasma of
density <span class="math">\(\simeq n_0\)</span> and the magnetosphere plasma of density <span class="math">\(\simeq 0.1~n_0\)</span>.
At this time, the exhaust is filled with mixed solar wind/hot magnetospheric plasma as
the plume (of density <span class="math">\(\simeq 2~n_0\)</span>) is still located at <span class="math">\(\simeq 10~c/\omega_{pi}\)</span>
from the magnetospheric separatrix. The reconnection rate during this period has a
typical value around <span class="math">\(0.1~\Omega_{ci}^{-1}\)</span>, with important fluctuations caused
by plasmoid formation. The plume, originally at <span class="math">\(20~c/\omega_{pi}\)</span> from the magnetopause,
is slowly advected towards the magnetosphere separatrix and finally touches the
reconnection site at about <span class="math">\(t=300~\Omega_{ci}^{-1}\)</span>. The second panel at
<span class="math">\(t=370~\Omega_{ci}^{-1}\)</span> shows the plume starting to fill the exhaust after
reaching the reconnection site and mixing with solar wind plasma.
At this time, the reconnection rate collapses to about half its previous value.
The transition phase lasts for about <span class="math">\(100~\Omega_{ci}^{-1}\)</span> before a plume
reconnection regime reaches a quasi-steady state.
The third panel shows the electron density at the end of the simulation,
where the exhaust is filled with plume and solar wind plasma.</p>
<p>This large-scale simulation has run for a total of 14 million CPU-hours on 16384 cores
of the CINES/Occigen (Bullx) supercomputer within a GENCI-CINES special call.
Overall, the characteristic (full) push-time for a single particle was of the order
of 1.6 µs (including 31% for diagnostics).
No dynamic load balancing was used for this simulation.</p>

<div class="section" id="collisionless-shock-in-pair-plasmas">
<h2>Collisionless shock in pair plasmas<a class="headerlink" href="#collisionless-shock-in-pair-plasmas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Relativistic collisionless shocks play a fundamental role in various astrophysical scenarios
(active galactic nuclei, micro-quasars, pulsar wind nebulae and gamma-ray bursts)
where they cause high-energy radiation and particle acceleration related to the
cosmic-ray spectrum. In the absence of particle collisions, the shock is mediated
by collective plasma processes, produced by electromagnetic plasma instabilities
at the shock front.</p>
<p>Specifically, the Weibel (or current filamentation) instability
is observed in most of the astrophysical relativistic outflows interacting with
the interstellar medium. It can be excited by counter-streaming unmagnetized relativistic
flows, and dominates the instability spectrum for a wide range of parameters.
The resulting strong magnetic turbulence can isotropize the incoming flow,
hence stopping it and leading to compression of the downstream (shocked plasma) and shock formation.</p>
<p>We present a 2-dimensional PIC simulation of such shock,
driven in an initially unmagnetized electron-positron plasma.
The simulation relies on the &#8220;piston&#8221; method that consists in initializing the
simulation with a single cold electron-positron plasma drifting
at a relativistic velocity <span class="math">\(v_0 \simeq 0.995\,c\)</span>.
Reflecting boundary conditions at the right border creates a counter-penetrating flow.</p>
<p>The simulation box size is 2048 <span class="math">\(\delta_e \times\)</span> 128 <span class="math">\(\delta_e\)</span>
(<span class="math">\(\delta_e = c/\omega_p\)</span> being the electron skin-depth of the initial flow),
with a total of 2.15 billion quasi-particles.
The following figure show an unstable overlapping region of incoming and
reflected flows, resulting in the creation, before the shock
of filamentary structures in both the magnetic field (panel a) and
the total plasma density (panel b).</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/shock1.jpg"><img alt="_images/shock1.jpg" src="_images/shock1.jpg" style="width: 15cm;" /></a>
<p>The magnetic field at the shock front becomes turbulent and it is strong
enough to stop the incoming particles leading to a pile-up of the plasma
density (panel c).</p>
<p>The following figure demonstrates the build-up, at late times, of a supra-thermal tail
in the downstream particle energy distribution.
It is characteristic of first-order Fermi acceleration at the shock front,
and appears to follow a <span class="math">\(\gamma^{-2.5}\)</span> power law.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/shock3.jpg"><img alt="_images/shock3.jpg" src="_images/shock3.jpg" style="width: 11cm;" /></a>
<p>This simulation run on the TGCC/Curie machine using 128 MPI x 8 OpenMP threads
for a total of 18800 CPU-hours for 49780 timesteps.
The average push time for one quasi-particle was of 0.63 µs (including 20% for diagnostics).</p>

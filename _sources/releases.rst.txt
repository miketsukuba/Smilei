Releases
--------

Major releases are available here as well as on the
`GitHub page <https://github.com/SmileiPIC/Smilei>`_.
We greatly appreciate external users trying this code and giving feedback.

You can :doc:`contact us <partners>` to become a developer of the official releases:
the `developer's Gitlab repository <https://llrgit.in2p3.fr/smilei/smilei>`_ is used
for development, and you will need to ask for a password first,
but the process is fast and straightforward.

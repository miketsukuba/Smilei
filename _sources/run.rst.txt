Run
---

Before you launch :program:`Smilei`, :doc:`write a namelist file<namelist>`
containing all the information of your simulation (grid shape, particles, lasers, diagnostics, etc.).

You can also start by picking up one simulation from the ``benchmarks`` directory.

----

The ``smilei`` executable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Compiling Smilei <compile>`_ creates an executable file ``smilei`` in the source directory.

.. code-block:: bash
  
  smilei arg1 arg2 arg3 ...

The command-line arguments ``arg1``, ``arg2``, ``arg3`` (etc.) can be:

* the path to a namelist
* any *python* instruction that you want to execute during the namelist reading.

For example, you can run your namelist ``my_namelist.py`` and 
add an additional instruction ``print_every=10``:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  ./smilei  my_namelist.py  "print_every=10"

Note that, in addition, you will generally use the ``mpiexec`` or ``mpirun`` command
to run :program:`Smilei` on several processors:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  mpiexec -np 4 ./smilei  my_namelist.py  "print_every=10"


----

Directory management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let us assume you have written your namelist ``my_namelist.py``, and that you placed it
inside your home directory. Also, we assume that the ``Smilei`` directory is also there,
so that the ``smilei`` executable is located in ``~/Smilei/``.

Knowing that :program:`Smilei` generally writes out all the results in the current directory,
it is recommended to create a new directory to store these results. For instance:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ mkdir ~/my_simulation                     # New directory to store results
  $ cp ~/my_namelist.py ~/my_simulation       # Copies the namelist there
  $ cd ~/my_simulation                        # Goes there
  $ mpiexec -np 4 ~/Smilei/smilei my_namelist # Run with 4 processors

----

Using the provided script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For simple cases such as the previous one, use the script ``smilei.sh``, provided in
the `Smilei` directory. You only have to run

.. code-block:: bash
  
  $ ./smilei.sh 4 my_namelist.py

where the number 4 says that the code will run on 4 processors. A directory will all
the results will automatically be created next to your namelist.

----

Running on large clusters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We do not provide instructions to run on super-computers yet. Please refer to your
administrators.


----

Debugging
^^^^^^^^^

In case of problems, the code can be compiled with additional debugging flags (usual ``-g`` and ``-O0``) and internal 
checks by compiling it with 

.. code-block:: bash
  
    make config=debug

Compiling the whole code with this command will make it very slow to run. 
But to check only a particular file for errors, first compile the code with `make`, then
modify the file, and recompile in debug mode.

In debug mode, these C++ macros are activated:

* ``DEBUG("some text" [<< other streamable])``
* ``HEREIAM("some text" [<< other streamable])``
